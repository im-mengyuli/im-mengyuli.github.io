I teach undergraduate and graduate level courses at both UWM and HKBU in areas such as introductory communication theories, public relations and marketing, and advanced data analysis and research methods.

## University of Wisconsin-Madison
- JOURN 201 Introduction to Mass Communication - School of Journalism & Mass Communication
    - Focusing on news, advertising, and public relations in our mediated world, this course examine the social, economic, historical, and political impacts of media on society. Students will learn about the ways individuals consume, process, and interact with traditional and social media at the same time as reflecting critically on issues from health messaging to political campaign ads to news coverage to racial bias in entertainment. This course is about exploring conceptual tools for understanding how and why our societyâ€™s mediated communications work the way they do, and helping students develop knowledge and skills applicable across contexts and in different forms of media.
