I am a Ph.D. candidate in Mass Communications in the [School of Journalism and Mass Communication](https://journalism.wisc.edu/), with a minor in Educational Psychology: Quantitative Methods at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, advised by Professor [Dhavan Shah](https://journalism.wisc.edu/news/staff/dhavan-v-shah/). Currently, I am honored to be the Helen Firstbrook Franklin Wisconsin Distinguished Graduate Fellow for 2024-25. I am a researcher in the [Social Media and Democracy (SMAD)](https://mcrc.journalism.wisc.edu/groups/smad/) and as a student fellow at the [Center for Communication and Democracy (CCD)](https://ccd.journalism.wisc.edu/) and the [Institute for Diversity Science (IDS)](https://ids.wisc.edu/) at UW-Madison.

My research focuses on digital media, political communication, and media psychology. I employ computational methods (including natural language processing, large language models, and multi-modal analysis) and quantitative methods (including web-based experiments and cross-national surveys) to investigate **the increasing complexity of digital media in influencing people’s perception and engagement in gender politics and women’s health issues**. My past and ongoing work theorizes and empirically examines:

1. **Multiplatform hybridity of digital media**: How do social media platform affordances (e.g., algorithmic curation, shared group culture, connectivity) shape political discourse and mobilization efforts within and across different platforms?
2. **Multimodal richness of digital media**: How do multimodal content (e.g., background music, short videos, presidential debates) and AI-powered media (e.g., comment bots) impact users’ (mis)perception and online interaction with social issues on digital media?

I obtained my M.Phil. degree in Communication Studies from [Hong Kong Baptist University](https://www.comm.hkbu.edu.hk/comd-www/english/front/index.htm), my M.A. degree in Global Communication from the [Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.com.cuhk.edu.hk/), and my bachelor’s degree in Management from [Renmin University of China](https://en.ruc.edu.cn/). Outside academia, I have worked as a marketing intern and content editor intern at [Emerald Group Publishing Limited](https://www.emeraldgrouppublishing.com/) and [NetEase](https://news.163.com/world/index.html), focusing on optimizing marketing strategies and multiplatform social media campaigns.
